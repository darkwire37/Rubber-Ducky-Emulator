# Rubber-Ducky-Emulator
A python3 program to emulate a Duckyscript locally!

## Usage
The script you want to run must be in a text file.  The program requires a single parameter that is the path of the script file.

EG:
`python3 duckyEmu.py /home/user/script.txt`

## Feedback
If you find that a line in your script doesn't work, please let me know in issues so I can make the program better!  Thanks!

#### Please use this legally.  (Be nice, it won't kill you)
